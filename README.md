# linux 2-in-1 laptops and tablets
Lets run linux in your extensible 2 in 1 laptop or tablets ! I have gathered a list of extensible models because we want to upgrade ram and still enjoy small size


## remarks
MPP = Microsoft Pen Protocol


In general,I found the smalliest size for upgradeable ram and discrete gpu is 14 inch 2 in 1. I didn't find any tablets with upgradeable ram but correct me if you find one.


PRs are welcome!
